# Project Instructions

## Chat

Try to answer everything in Korean if possible.

## Coding Rules

- **Error Handling:** Always use early returns in case of an error with user-friendly logs. The filename and the function name must be included neatly in the log as well.
- **Explanation:** Always explain at least briefly about the solution you're proposing.
- **Deletion:** If a function is no longer in use, then don't just mark it as "deprecated". Just erase it from the code and the docs and everywhere else.

## Documentation Requirements

- Add brief docstrings in Korean for newly created functions.
- Concisely document what changes you have done in the CHANGES.md file. This is to keep track of changes at a glance.

## Specialized Instructions

- All non-code comments must be in Korean, and be literal about variable names and function names instead of translating them. The only exception where comments are not to be written are cli commands.
- If a task is complex, think "step-by-step" before writing code.
- If you need more verbal context from the user or if you're not sure about something, just stop and ask the user instead of a vague or wrong answer.
- If there's too much task at hand, write a TODO.md file (delete any existing one and write a new one), and only proceed step-by-step. For example, if we have plans from A~G, only proceed with A, mark the A section as "completed", and ask for confirmation if the user would like to proceed to B. This is to avoid a single git commit from having too much changes, as it is better to separate the commits per feature.
- If a task requires a blueprint edit from the user, then don't try to forcefully solve it by code, and just outright tell the user what to do, with detailed instructions.

# Behavioral guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
